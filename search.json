    "section": "Improved Documentation",
    "text": "Improved Documentation\nThe focus of recent work on measr has been to improve documentation. To that end, the existing vignettes have been updated, and several new vignettes have been added.\nFirst, the getting started vignette has been updated to include additional installation information. This should help reduce the friction for setting up the components needed for measr, namely, installing Stan. Because measr interfaces with Stan to estimate DCMs, a working Stan installation is needed for the package to function properly. The updated vignette includes helpful guidance for installing both the rstan and cmdstanr packages for using Stan. Only one of the two is required, but both are supported so you can choose whichever Stan front end you prefer.\nA new vignette on model evaluation has been added to demonstrate different methods for assessing the performance of a DCM after it has been estimated. This includes the M2 statistic (Liu et al., 2016), as well as posterior predictive model checks for evaluating both overall and item-level model fit (Sinharay & Almond, 2007; Thompson, 2019). To demonstrate how these methods are implemented for measr, a simulated data set is used where we know how well different types of DCMs should fit. The existing model estimation vignette was also updated to use this same simulated data set so that we can compare parameter estimates derived from measr to the known parameter values that were used to generate the data.\nBecause the model estimation and evaluation vignettes now use simulated data, we also added a case study to walk through a DCM-based analysis from start to finish using a real data set. In this case study, data from the Examination for the Certificate of Proficiency in English (ECPE), which has been widely used in the DCM literature (e.g., Templin & Hoffman, 2013). We start with exploratory analyses, then we estimate a DCM, examine parameter estimates, and interpret model fit and reliability analyses.\nFinally, example uses have been added for all functions included in measr. These examples can be found on the documentation pages for each function. All functions are indexed on the reference page, which has been reorganized to group functions with related functionality."

The goal of measr is to provide applied researchers and psychometricians with a user friendly interface for estimating and evaluating diagnostic classification models (DCMs). DCMs are a class of psychometric models that provide classification of students into profiles of proficiency on a predefined set of knowledge, skills, or understandings. This offers many advantages over traditional assessment models. Because results are reported as proficiency on individual skills, teachers, students, and parents get actionable feedback about which areas could use additional attention. However, these models have not been widely used in applied or operational settings, in part due to a lack of user friendly software for estimating and evaluating these models. measr aims to bridge this gap between psychometric theory and applied practice.\nYou can install it from CRAN with:\ninstall.packages(\"measr\")\nThis blog post will highlight the main features of the package.\nlibrary(measr)"

There are many different types of DCMs, each with different constraints or assumptions about how the attributes relate to each other. For example, if an item measures multiple attributes, does a respondent need to be proficient on all attributes to answer the item correctly? Or can proficiency in one attribute compensate for the lack of proficiency on another?\nAlso several DCM subtypes are supported by measr, we are primarily focused on the loglinear cognitive diagnostic model (LCDM), which is a general DCM. This means that it subsumes many of the other DCM subtypes and allows for the data to determine how much (if at all) one attribute might compensate for another.\nmeasr works by wrapping the Stan language to estimate DCMs. We can estimate the LCDM using measr_dcm(). This function use the inputs to write a Stan script defining the model and then estimates the model using either the rstan or cmdstanr packages. To estimate the model, we just supply our data set and the Q-matrix. Because our data set and Q-matrix contain respondent and item identifiers, respectively, we need to specify the names of the identifier columns. We can also specify prior distributions for each of the model parameters. Finally, we specify a file for saving the model once it is estimated. For more information on model estimation, including details on specifying prior distributions, see the model estimation vignette.\n\nlcdm &lt;- measr_dcm(data = dat, qmatrix = qmatrix,\n                  resp_id = \"resp_id\", item_id = \"item_id\", \n                  prior = c(prior(normal(0, 2), class = \"intercept\"),\n                            prior(lognormal(0, 1), class = \"maineffect\"),\n                            prior(normal(0, 2), class = \"interaction\")),\n                  file = \"fits/example-lcdm\")\n\nOnce the model has estimated, we can use measr_extract() to examine different aspects of the model, such as proportion of respondents with each pattern of proficiency across the attributes.\n\nmeasr_extract(lcdm, \"strc_param\")\n#&gt; # A tibble: 8 × 2\n#&gt;   class          estimate\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;rvar[1d]&gt;\n#&gt; 1 [0,0,0]  0.165 ± 0.0127\n#&gt; 2 [1,0,0]  0.211 ± 0.0153\n#&gt; 3 [0,1,0]  0.048 ± 0.0089\n#&gt; 4 [0,0,1]  0.072 ± 0.0090\n#&gt; 5 [1,1,0]  0.166 ± 0.0164\n#&gt; 6 [1,0,1]  0.065 ± 0.0115\n#&gt; 7 [0,1,1]  0.084 ± 0.0116\n#&gt; 8 [1,1,1]  0.187 ± 0.0164"

    "text": "Model Specifications\nIn this version, support for a new DCM subtype was added. The compensatory reparameterized unified model (C-RUM) model can now be specified in measr_dcm() with type = \"crum\". The C-RUM is similar to the log-linear cognitive diagnostic model (LCDM), except the C-RUM estimates only item-level intercepts and main effects (i.e., no interactions when multiple attributes are measured by an item). Because of this, along with the addition of the C-RUM, the LCDM now has additional flexibility through the new max_interaction argument. When using type = \"lcdm\", max_interaction specifies the highest level interaction to be estimated. For example, setting max_interaction = 2 would estimate the LCDM with only intercepts, main effects, and two-way interactions. If an item measures 3 or more attributes, the 3-way interactions and higher will be excluded. Specifying type = \"lcdm\" with max_interaction = 1 is equivalent to the C-RUM, as 1 indicates that main effects are the highest-level interaction to be estimated.\nThis version also introduces new options for the structural component of the DCMs. Currently two attributes structures are possible, and are defined through the attribute_structure argument. The first is attribute_structure = \"unconstrained\". This is the default, which makes no assumptions about the relationships between attributes. Specifying and unconstrained structural model is equivalent to the saturated structural model described by Hu & Templin (2020) and in Chapter 8 of Rupp et al. (2010). The other option currently supported is attribute_structure = \"independent\". When an independent attribute structure is specified, the proficiency or the presence of one attribute is independent of other attributes. Future development will include additional attribute structure specifications such as a reduced loglinear model (e.g., Thompson, 2018) or a Bayesian Network (e.g., Hu & Templin, 2020; Martinez & Templin, 2023)."

We can view the default parameters for each attribute structure specification with:\n\ndefault_dcm_priors(type = \"lcdm\", attribute_structure = \"unconstrained\")\n#&gt; # A tibble: 4 × 3\n#&gt;   class       coef  prior_def                  \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                      \n#&gt; 1 intercept   &lt;NA&gt;  normal(0, 2)               \n#&gt; 2 maineffect  &lt;NA&gt;  lognormal(0, 1)            \n#&gt; 3 interaction &lt;NA&gt;  normal(0, 2)               \n#&gt; 4 structural  Vc    dirichlet(rep_vector(1, C))\n\ndefault_dcm_priors(type = \"lcdm\", attribute_structure = \"independent\")\n#&gt; # A tibble: 4 × 3\n#&gt;   class       coef  prior_def      \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          \n#&gt; 1 intercept   &lt;NA&gt;  normal(0, 2)   \n#&gt; 2 maineffect  &lt;NA&gt;  lognormal(0, 1)\n#&gt; 3 interaction &lt;NA&gt;  normal(0, 2)   \n#&gt; 4 structural  &lt;NA&gt;  beta(1, 1)\n\nWe can also view the specific parameters available for a specific model using the get_parameters() function. For example, using the ECPE Q-matrix, we can see the available parameters for each type of model.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nget_parameters(ecpe_qmatrix, attribute_structure = \"unconstrained\") |&gt; \n  filter(class == \"structural\")\n#&gt; # A tibble: 1 × 4\n#&gt;   item_id class      attributes coef  \n#&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;glue&gt;\n#&gt; 1      NA structural &lt;NA&gt;       Vc\n\nget_parameters(ecpe_qmatrix, attribute_structure = \"independent\") |&gt; \n  filter(class == \"structural\")\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 4\n#&gt;   item_id class      attributes coef  \n#&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;glue&gt;\n#&gt; 1      NA structural &lt;NA&gt;       eta[1]\n#&gt; 2      NA structural &lt;NA&gt;       eta[2]\n#&gt; 3      NA structural &lt;NA&gt;       eta[3]\n\nThe second improvement is additional checking of user-specified priors. Specifically, measr_dcm() will now throw and error if we try to specify a prior for a class or coefficient that is inconsistent with our chosen DCM. For example, in the previous example of structural model priors that there are different parameters depending on whether an unconstrained or independent structure is specified. If we try to define a prior for eta[1], which is only relevant for an independent structure, but an unconstrained structure is specified, we get an error.\n\nmeasr_dcm(data = ecpe_data, qmatrix = ecpe_qmatrix,\n          resp_id = \"resp_id\", item_id = \"item_id\",\n          attribute_structure = \"unconstrained\",\n          prior = prior(beta(5,17), class = \"structural\", coef = \"eta[1]\"))\n#&gt; Error in `abort_bad_argument()`:\n#&gt; ! Prior for parameter `eta[1]` with class `structural` is not relevant for the chosen model or specified Q-matrix. See `?get_parameters()` for a list of relevant parameters.\n\nAs always, please open an issue with any bugs or feature requests for future development!"
