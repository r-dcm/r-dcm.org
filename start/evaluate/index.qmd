## Introduction

The second article will focus on tools for evaluating an estimated DCM model.
This will include tools for calculating:

* Absolute fit (e.g., `fit_ppmc()`, `fit_m2()`)
* Relative fit for model comparisons (e.g., `waic()`, `loo()`)

We will showcase tools for investigating potential causes of misfit such as:

* Incorrect Q-matrix specifications (`qmatrix_validation()`)
* Local item dependence (`yens_q3()`)
* Item and attribute discrimination (`cdi()`)
