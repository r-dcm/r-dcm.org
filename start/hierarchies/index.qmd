## Introduction

The third article will focus on identifying and estimating attribute relationships.
We will discuss how to identify when a hierarchy might be present in your data and then how to model that hierarchy using different structural model specifications (e.g., `hdcm()`, `bayes_net()`).

We'll then explore how to compare models with a specified hierarchy to a saturated model to evaluate the impact of the hierarchy on model fit.
